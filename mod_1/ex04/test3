You put your left arm in
Your left arm out
In, out, in, out
You shake it all about

You do the hokey cokey
And you turn around
That's what it's all about

Woah, the hokey cokey
Woah, the hokey cokey
Woah, the hokey cokey
Knees bent
Arms stretched
Ra-ra-ra

You put your right arm in
Your right arm out
In, out, in, out
You shake it all about

You do the hokey cokey
And you turn around
That's what it's all about

Woah, the hokey cokey
Woah, the hokey cokey
Woah, the hokey cokey
Knees bent
Arms stretched
Ra-ra-ra

You put your left leg in
Your left leg out
In, out, in, out
You shake it all about

You do the hokey cokey
And you turn around
That's what it's all about

Woah, the hokey cokey
Woah, the hokey cokey
Woah, the hokey cokey
Knees bent
Arms stretched
Ra-ra-ra

You put your right leg in
Your right leg out
In, out, in, out
You shake it all about

You do the hokey cokey
And you turn around
That's what it's all about

All together now
Wah, the hokey cokey
Woah, the hokey cokey
Woah, the hokey cokey
Knees bent, arms stretched
Ra-ra-ra

You put your whole self in
Your whole self out
In, out
Shake it all about

Do the hokey cokey
And you turn around
That's what it's all about
Wait for it!

Woah, the hokey cokey
Woah, the hokey cokey
Woah, the hokey cokey
Knees bent
Arms stretched
Ra-ra-ra

Woah, the hokey cokey
Woah, the hokey cokey
Woah, the hokey cokey
Knees bent
Arms stretched
Ra-ra-ra
And that's that!
